Wait for the Flash video currently playing to finish downloading, then save it.
Designed for the Linux GNOME desktop.

Important: Not all websites serving Flash videos use the same technique.
 In particular, for YouTube videos and for sites where the "Video URL" is
 explicitly specified, you may have better success using a download utility
 such as 'youtube-dl'.

Requirements:
 'zenity' installed (part of the GNOME desktop). To check, do this from terminal:
    # zenity --version
 Firefox or Chrome browser with Flash plugin. To check your version:
    Type "about:plugins" in the browser address bar. Then scroll down to
    find the Shockwave Flash Version. It should be something like "10.2 r159"
 'mplayer' installed - used to find the final size of the video that's
    currently being downloaded. To check, do this from terminal:
    # mplayer --help

Setup:
 1. Make this script executable (e.g. chmod 744 ~/bin/grabdlvid.sh)
 2. Configure the script by editing the Configuration Section.
 3. If you want to call grabdlvid.sh via a GNOME custom keyboard shortcut
    (recommended), set it up at System/Preferences/Keyboard Shortcuts:
       Click 'Add' then:
          Name: Grab Downloading Video
          Command: grabdlvid.sh
 4. If you also want a 'Save Now' option via a (different) GNOME custom  
    keyboard shortcut (recommended), click 'Add' again, then:
       Name: Save Downloading Video Now
       Command: grabdlvid.sh savenow

Usage:
 This script must be called DURING video playback. If you set up a GNOME
 custom keyboard shortcut, simply press that key. Otherwise from the terminal:
    grabdlvid.sh

How it works:
 This script tries to find videos that are being downloaded using either
 of two different Flash techniques: 
    a) Temp file. Prior to Flash 10.2, it was easy to find the file yourself
       in the /tmp file but starting with version 10.2, this script is a lot
       more useful because the file is deleted but internally still open.
    b) Browser cache - backup method. Less reliable because there may be a
       size limit that this script cannot overcome.
 If neither finds the file, try a download utility such as youtube-dl.

Tested on Fedora 14 with:
    Firefox 3.6.17 with Shockwave Flash 10.2 r159
    Google Chrome 7.0.517.44 with Shockwave Flash 10.1 r103
    Google Chrome 11.0.696.77 with Shockwave Flash 10.3 r181
