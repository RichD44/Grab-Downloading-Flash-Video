Wait for the Flash video currently playing to finish downloading, then copy it.
Usage: grabdlvid.sh [copytodir] [interrupt-key] [interrupt-file]
 where:
	 copytodir - directory into which downloaded Flash videos will be copied.
					 Default is COPYTODIR configured below.
	 interrupt-key - name of key used to interrupt the script.
					 Default is INTERRUPTKEY configured below.
	 interrupt-file - path of file whose contents is set to "1" when
					 interrupt-key is pressed. See the description of INTERRUPTFILE
					 below for how to write the required one-line script.
					 Default is INTERRUPTFILE configured below.

Important: Not all websites serving Flash videos use the same technique.
 In particular, for YouTube videos and for sites where the "Video URL" is
 explicitly specified, you may have better success using a download utility
 such as 'youtube-dl'.

Designed for the Linux GNOME desktop and Firefox browser. Modifications may
 be needed for other environments. Tested on Fedora FC14 and Firefox 3.6.

Requirements:
 'zenity' installed (part of the GNOME desktop). To check, do this from terminal:
	 # zenity --version
 Firefox browser with Flash 10.2 plugin installed (older versions use a
	 different downloading technique). To check your version:
	 Type "about:plugins" in your Firefox address bar. Then scroll down to
	 find the Shockwave Flash Version. It should be something like "10.2 r159"
 'mplayer' installed - used to find the final size of the video that's
	 currently being downloaded. To check, do this from terminal:
	 # mplayer --help
	 grabdlvid will work if mplayer is not installed but the progress bar
	 won't work because the final file size will be unknown.

 Designed to be called either of two ways:
	 1. Via a GNOME Custom Keyboard shortcut (e.g. F5). No parameters are needed
		 but you must set up the default params in the Configuration Section below.
		 To configure a specific key, go to System/Preferences/Keyboard Shortcuts.
	 2. From a terminal window. This is less convenient but you don't have to
		 define a GNOME Custom Keyboard shortcut.
 Notes:
	 1. Be sure this script is executable (e.g. chmod 744 ~/bin/grabdlvid.sh)
	 2. Be sure to call this script DURING video playback, at least 5
		 seconds before it's done playing. 
	 3. This script tries to find videos that are being downloaded using either
		 of two slightly different Flash 10.2 techniques: 
			 a) Deleted but still open temp file:
				 lsof | awk '/npviewer/&&/Flash/&&/deleted/'
			 b) Firefox cache:
				 lsof | awk '$1=="firefox" && $4!="mem" && $5=="REG" && /Cache/&& !/_CACHE/'
			 If neither finds the file, try download utility such as youtube-dl.
	 4. The Firefox cache seems to impose a size limit on "larger" files, causing
	    this script to be unsuitable for some downloads. So it's not a "one size fits all"
		 solution. Contributions or suggestions about fixing this problem are welcome.
